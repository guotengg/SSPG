# SSPG: Scale and Spatial Priors Guided Generalizable and Interpretable Pedestrian Attribute Recognition
A novel SSPG is proposed with the guidence of both scale and spatial prior for PAR. The SSPG is mainly composed of the AFSS and PLE modules. The AFSS module learns to provide reasonable scale prior information for different attribute types, allowing the model to focus on different levels of feature maps with varying semantic granularity. The PLE module reveals potential attribute spatial prior information, which avoids unnecessary attention on irrelevant areas and lowers the risk of model over-fitting.
